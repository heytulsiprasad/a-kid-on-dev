# Hey There
---
I'm Tulsi Prasad and I'm glad you're here. As you might have guessed, I am an avid blogger and I choose to post my blogs on the DEV Community, almost every week. This is the repo for all my blogs. Apart from all that, I am curious and enthuasiastic learner of the trends in full stack development and now I'm more focused into world of Frontend. 

## What I'm skilled at?
---
You can see me putting up a plethora of pages build with pure **HTML**, **CSS** and **Vanilla JavaScript**, also a tint of **jQuery** at times. I try to learn the deep way and understand concepts from its grass root levels, so that I can deliver the best of all worlds into my projects, minimizing the chances of getting stuck amidst my projects.

## What are you learning or blogging about?
---
I merged those two questions intentionally, because I don't usually spend any extra time for blogging as in that way I can't be able to use what I'm currently learning. So my preffered way of learning is to, **Learn**, **Build** and then **Blog** or **Share** about what I've learnt. In this way, I can maximize what I learn, as it's rightely said, **"to teach is to learn twice"**.

To answer the first question, I'm more into Frontend development so I'm trying to hone my skills on **React** for building **soothing** and **user-centered interfaces**, so that we can deliver the best of our products. I'm also planning to build my skills with **React Native** once I'm done with the web part.

## What can we build together?
---
There's pretty much nothing, that we can't **learn** or **build** from scratch together. All it takes is your consistence and commitment towards building it and I'm always ready to hear out new project ideas. Also, I'm quite serious about finishing my projects, as that's a good practice.

## I'm here for yah!
